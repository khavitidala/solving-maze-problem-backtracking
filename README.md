# Solving Maze Problems Using Backtracking
Given the matrix input of i.txt, 1 represents a usable path and 0 represents a block that the agent can't pass through. The agent would start from top-left (0,0) and go through the usable path using a backtracking algorithm to find the solution that leads the agent from start to finish (n-1, n-1; n is the length of the matrix maze).
